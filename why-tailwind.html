                    <p class="text-xl font-light my-5">
                    I have been working with Semantic-UI for 4 years now on many different projects, but since it lost support in 2018, I started looking for an alternative. 
                    That is when I found tailwind and fell in love immediately. I liked how it is similar in vision of what Semantic-UI aimed to do, which is making styling understandable, but tailwind approach is much more practical and extensive in features.

                    <p class="text-xl font-light my-5">
                    I love using tools to create things & making tools to help people make things, and I see both of these possible in tailwind. 
                    I want to work on creating pages & components using tailwind and delve deep into design to give people the best product, while also looking into the pipeline of the process and see where we can improve on it to make it simpler & more efficient for everyone.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-xl font-light my-5">
                    I would be honored to be provided the chance to be considered for this undeniably great position. Thank you for your time and consideration.
