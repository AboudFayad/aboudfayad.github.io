I want to be part of your awesome team, and here is <strong class="font-semibold text-yellow-500 whitespace-nowrap">Why ...</strong></p>

                    I have been working with Semantic-UI for 4 years on several different projects. However, since it lost support in 2018, I started looking for an alternative. That is when I found railwind and fell in love with immediately. I was amused by tailwind’s vision and what it aimed to do, which is making styling understandable. tailwind’s approach has proved itself to be more practical and extensive in countless features.

                    <p class="md:text-xl sm:text-lg font-light my-5">
                    I love using and producing new tools to create, innovate and build on ideas. My main goal is to help people design and explore new projects. I envision myself achieving these goals while working with an outstanding team like tailwind. I am excited to work on creating pages & components using tailwind services and to delve deep into design. 
                    I aim to give people the best product, while also exploring and studying the pipeline of the process to improve on it, in order to provide a simpler and a more efficient platform for everyone to utilize.

                    I would be ecstatically honored to be provided the opportunity to work in this undeniably great position. Thank you for your time and consideration.
